# Guess-The-numbers-Game
We’re building a console game where:
The computer picks a random number between 1 and 100.

The user guesses until they get it right.

After each guess, the program gives a hint: “Too high,” “Too low,” or “You got it!”

We’ll add basic error handling for invalid inputs (e.g., letters instead of numbers).
